# Back-end with no database
This folder implements our Q&A api without any database. Instead data is stored in memory.

## Installation
### `yarn install`
You can run `npm install` instead.

## Practice
Challenge yourself by trying to create your own back-end.

- Create Express server
- Use Postman to test endpoints
- Add routes
- Update the in-memory data within the route handlers
