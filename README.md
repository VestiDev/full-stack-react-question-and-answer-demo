# Full-Stack React

## About this project
These are the class materials for the Full-Stack React class on O'Reilly. The folders represent what we will build during each step of the class.

1. A standalone front-end application. *See the [`front-end-standalone`](/front-end-standalone) folder.*
2. An API that isn't connected to a database. *See the [`back-end-no-db`](/back-end-no-db) folder.*
3. A connected full stack application. *See the [`full-stack`](/full-stack) folder.*

Each folder contains a README.md file explaining how to get started. Generally speaking, you will run `yarn install` or `npm install` and then run `yarn start` or `npm start`.
