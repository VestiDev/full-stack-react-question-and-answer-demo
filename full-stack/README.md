# Complete Full-Stack Project
This folder contains our complete full-stack Q&A application.

## Practice
This portion of the repository includes the Mongo database and stitches together the front-end, back-end, and database.

1. Start the database and run some test queries using the [MONGO_DB_QUICKSTART](MONGO_DB_QUICKSTART.md) guide.
2. [Update the back-end](../back-end/README.md) to connect to the database. Test using Postman.
3. [Update the front-end](../front-end/README.md) to connect to the API using Redux Thunks to make requests to the new back-end.
4. Once you have your code running locally. Follow the [RUN_ON_EC2.md](RUN_ON_EC2.md) guide to deploy to EC2.
